 - Focused on lesion detection in Chest CT images
    - Developed a pulmonary nodule detection algorithm on chest CT images. The algorithm ranks the global runner-up of the [LUNA16 grand challenge](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/Results/).
    - Implemented a data-annotation tool using JavaFX to let analysts label medical images.
    - Developed a pneumothorax detection/segmentation system for x-ray images, achieved DICE 0.892.
    - Led a team in developing cloud-based CADe platforms, which are being used in multiple clinical centers in China. 
    - Promoted to be the head of the department in 2017.

 - Public activities including: 
    - Speaker in the [Westlake healthcare forum 2016](http://www.wlimf.com/category/2016/) with 2k+ audience. 
    - Helped the company host the Westlake healthcare forum 2017.
    - Helped the company CEO to present our nodule detection system in the national television program (CCTV) [Artificial Intelligence VS Human Intelligence 20171222](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlKRc_Np-s).
